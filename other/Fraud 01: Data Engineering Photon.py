# MAGIC %md # ATM Fraud Analytics
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **According to the Secret Service, the crime is responsible for about $350,000 of monetary losses each day in the United States and is considered to be the number one ATM-related crime. Trade group Global ATM Security Alliance estimates that skimming costs the U.S.-banking industry about $60 million a year.**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The easiest way that companies identify atm fraud is by recognizing a break in spending patterns.  For example, if you live in Wichita, KS and suddenly your card is used to buy something in Bend, OR â€“ that may tip the scales in favor of possible fraud, and your credit card company might decline the charges and ask you to verify them.

# MAGIC %md # Fraud 01: Data Engineering
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The first step to prevent **ATM fraud** is to make sure we can ingest, clean and organize our data in a **performant**, **reliable** and **cost efficient** manner.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Here we are going to create a streaming pipeline to increasingly improve our data quality while moving through different layers of our **Lakehouse** and deliver it to be consumed by **BI** reports and **ML** models.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Delta Lake** is a key enabler of this architecture, reducing the work required by data engineers to develop and maintain these pipelines.<br><br>
